This is a unofficial reimplementation of the NeurIPS 2022 paper [MCVD: Masked Conditional Video Diffusion for Prediction, Generation, and Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09853). In this paper, we devise a general-purpose model for video prediction (forward and backward), unconditional generation, and interpolation with Masked Conditional Video Diffusion (MCVD) models. Original project page is on [website](https://mask-cond-video-diffusion.github.io/) for more details.

--- Ongoing: 
YouTube Driving Dataset Video Prediction
* Downloaded Driving Video from Youtube , Train MCVD on these driving video to conduct prediction tasks
* MCVD training pipeline completed -- but performance is still less than promising here
